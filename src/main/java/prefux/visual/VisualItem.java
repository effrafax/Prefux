/**
 * <p>Base interface for representing a visual item, a data object with a
 * visual interactive form. VisualItems are Tuple instances, and so
 * can support any number of data fields in a backing data table. VisualItems
 * also support data fields specific to visualization, such as a location,
 * bounding box, colors, size, and font. The VisualItem interface provides
 * convenience methods for accessing these common visual properties, but
 * the underlying mechanism is the same as any Tuple -- data stored in
 * a tabular format. Just as all Tuple instances are backed by a data Table,
 * each VisualItem is backed by a VisualTable. Additionally, each VisualItem
 * is associated with one and only one {@link prefux.Visualization}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>VisualItems are only responsible for storing their visual data
 * properties. The final visual appearance of an item is determined by
 * a {@link prefux.render.Renderer}, which contains instructions for drawing
 * the item. The Renderer to use for a given item is decided by the
 * {@link prefux.render.RendererFactory} associated with the item's
 * backing Visualization.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Finally, actually setting the visual properties of VisualItems is
 * commonly done by the many {@link prefux.action.Action} modules available
 * for processing visual data. This includes spatial layout as well as
 * color, size, and font assignment.</p>
